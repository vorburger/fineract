# See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-937 for background re. what below is all about..
# We basically remove the outdated OpenJDK 11.0.2 which Travis image grabbed from java.net in
# https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-cookbooks/blob/master/cookbooks/travis_jdk/files/install-jdk.sh#L200
# (which has 11.0.2 hard-coded!), and instead replace it with the latest openjdk-11-jdk-headless Ubuntu package.
# NB /usr/local/lib/jvm/openjdk11/bin is also on the PATH, but there's no need to change it (because we rm -rf anyway)

  - echo $JAVA_HOME

# NOTE: We used to run with --info, which is quite a bit more verbose, but is VERY useful to understand failures on Travis,
# where you do not have access to any files like build/reports/tests/index.html, only the Console.

# @see http://forums.gradle.org/gradle/topics/whats_new_in_gradle_1_1_test_logging for alternative
# https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-732 removed that again, because it made Travis CI fail.
